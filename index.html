                  The universe is filled with stars and other celestial objects
                  that hold the secrets of how everything came to be. This
                  article talks about how stars are born from clouds of gas and
                  dust called nebulae. It explains how gravity and pressure play
                  important roles in this process.

                the Hyades cluster is the closest star cluster to Earth, at a
                distance of 150 light-years. This cluster is very easy to spot
                in the night sky, because it has a compact and distinctive shape
                of the letter V
